# Signature-Based-Intrusion-Detection-System-Project
-- Implemented a Signature-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning algorithms, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The system is trained and evaluated on the UNSW-NB 15 dataset,uses a cross-validation to improve model performance and found that the Decision Tree model is better than the KNN model.
