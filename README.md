# Signature-Based-Intrusion-Detection-System-Project
-- This project implements a Signature-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning algorithms, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The system is trained and evaluated on the UNSW-NB 15 dataset.

-- Our project uses cross-validation to check how well our models work. We found that the Decision Tree model is better than the KNN model because it got a higher score. This means it can more accurately detect network intrusions.
